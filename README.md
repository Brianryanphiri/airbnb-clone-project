## Technology Stack

This project uses the following technologies:

- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces, used to create the frontend components and manage the user experience.
- **Node.js**: A JavaScript runtime used to build the backend server, enabling API endpoints and server-side logic.
- **Express.js**: A web application framework for Node.js, used to simplify API routing and middleware management.
- **PostgreSQL**: A relational database system used to store and manage the application data such as user accounts, property listings, and bookings.
- **Prisma**: An ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) tool to interact with the PostgreSQL database in a type-safe way.
- **GraphQL**: A query language for APIs, used to efficiently fetch and manipulate data between the frontend and backend.
- **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)**: Used for user authentication and authorization by securely transmitting information between client and server.
- **Vercel** or **Heroku** (or your chosen deployment platform): For hosting the frontend and backend applications.
- **GitHub**: Version control system to manage source code and collaboration.

## Feature Breakdown

### User Management
Allows users to register, log in, and manage their profiles. It supports different roles such as guests and hosts, enabling personalized experiences and secure authentication.

### Property Management
Hosts can create, update, and delete property listings with details like descriptions, photos, and availability. This feature helps showcase rental options and keeps listings up to date.

### Booking System
Enables guests to search for properties, make bookings, and view their booking history. It handles booking availability, confirmation, cancellations, and integrates with payment processing.

### Reviews and Ratings
Guests can leave reviews and rate properties they have stayed at, providing valuable feedback for other users and helping maintain quality standards.

### Payment Processing
Facilitates secure payment transactions for bookings, supporting multiple payment methods. It ensures smooth financial exchanges between guests and hosts.


## API Security

To ensure the security and integrity of the backend APIs, the following key measures will be implemented:

- **Authentication**: Using JWT (JSON Web Tokens) to verify the identity of users accessing the API, ensuring only authorized users can access protected resources.
- **Authorization**: Role-based access control will restrict user actions based on their role (e.g., guest, host, admin), preventing unauthorized operations.
- **Rate Limiting**: To protect the API from abuse and denial-of-service attacks, rate limiting will limit the number of requests a client can make within a certain timeframe.
- **Data Validation and Sanitization**: All incoming data will be validated and sanitized to prevent injection attacks and ensure data integrity.
- **Secure Payment Handling**: Payment-related endpoints will use encrypted channels (HTTPS) and comply with industry standards to protect sensitive financial information.

Security is critical to protect user data, maintain trust, and ensure safe transactions within the platform. By implementing these measures, the project safeguards against common threats and unauthorized access.

## CI/CD Pipeline

Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipelines automate the process of testing, building, and deploying the application whenever changes are made. This ensures faster delivery of features, consistent code quality, and quick identification of issues.

For this project, tools like **GitHub Actions** can be used to automate testing and deployment workflows. Additionally, **Docker** can help containerize the application, making deployments more reliable and scalable.

Implementing a CI/CD pipeline improves development efficiency and reduces the risk of errors in production.
